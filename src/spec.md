# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove demo/simulation messaging and polish user-facing copy so the app reads as publish-ready and professional.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the Discovery screen note that describes peer-to-peer connections as “simulated in this demo,” and replace it with a helpful, plain-English status message that doesn’t reference demos or simulations.
- Audit and update user-facing text across Discovery, Chat, Games, and the global AppShell footer to remove informal/placeholder phrasing and ensure consistent, professional English.
- Update the AppShell footer to remove the heart emoji and present the sentence as plain English (no disclaimers).

**User-visible outcome:** The Discovery flow no longer mentions simulations/demos, and the main screens (Discovery/Chat/Games) plus footer use consistent, professional English suitable for publishing, without changing the top-level navigation.
