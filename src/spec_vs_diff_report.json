The Discovery screen no longer shows the prior demo/simulation disclaimer and instead presents professional state messaging (scanning/online count/connected/etc.). Chat and Games screens include more publish-ready guidance text. AppShell is described (in the repo summaries) as having a plain-text footer without emoji, but the actual footer lines are not visible in the truncated AppShell diff excerpt.",
